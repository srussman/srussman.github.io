# Neural Data Analysis Codes

The codes below can be used to reproduce figures and data analysis from the paper titled "Constructing 2D Maps of Human Spinal Cord Activity and Isolating the Functional Midline with High-Density Microelectrode Arrays". It contains the following steps:
+ [data averaging](https://github.com/srussman/srussman.github.io/tree/main/data%20averaging)
+ baseline calculations
+ heatmap plots 
+ phase gradient analysis 
+ multidiameter analysis 
+ clinical data analysis
+ statistical analysis
