# Human Spinal Cord Data Analysis Code

The code below can be used to reproduce figures and data analysis from the paper titled "Constructing 2D Maps of Human Spinal Cord Activity and Isolating the Functional Midline with High-Density Microelectrode Arrays". It contains the following analysis steps:
+ [impedance mapping](https://github.com/srussman/srussman.github.io/tree/main/impedance%20mapping)
+ [data averaging](https://github.com/srussman/srussman.github.io/tree/main/data%20averaging)
+ [heatmap plots](https://github.com/srussman/srussman.github.io/tree/main/paper%20figures)
+ [phase gradient analysis](https://github.com/srussman/srussman.github.io/tree/main/paper%20figures/wavefront%20plots)
+ [multidiameter analysis](https://github.com/srussman/srussman.github.io/tree/main/paper%20figures)
+ clinical data analysis
+ statistical analysis
